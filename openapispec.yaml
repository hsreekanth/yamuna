            400 BAD REQUEST

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and
            4.5.3.4.

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and
            4.5.3.4.

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 BAD REQUEST

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and
            4.5.3.4.

            code and a message content with an empty array.

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API

            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 BAD REQUEST

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 BAD REQUEST

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            resource addressed by the URI passed in the request or is not
            willing to disclose that one exists, it shall respond with this

            container resource, a typical response contains a 200 OK response
            code and a message content with an empty array.

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

                  Compared to the general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807
                  [19], the "status" and "detail" attributes are mandated to be
                  included by the present document, to ensure that the response
                  contains additional textual information about an error. IETF
                  RFC 7807 [19] foresees extensibility of the "ProblemDetails"
                  type. It is possible that particular APIs in the present
                  document, or particular implementations, define extensions to
                  define additional attributes that provide more information
                  about the error. The description column only provides some
                  explanation of the meaning to Facilitate understanding of the

            400 BAD REQUEST

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API

            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC

            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 BAD REQUEST

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and
            4.5.3.4.

            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API

            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

            400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
            specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
            structure to be returned.

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the message
            content contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API
            producer shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
            structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
            attribute more information about the source of the problem.

            If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
            would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
            adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
            the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 9110. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

            The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
            applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
            requests and notifications, as defined in clauses 4.5.3.3 and

                    APIs in the present document, or particular implementations,

                    RFC 7807 [19], the "status" and "detail" attributes are
                    mandated to be included by the present document, to ensure
                    that the response contains additional textual information
                    about an error. IETF RFC 7807 [19] foresees extensibility of

                    APIs in the present document, or particular implementations,
